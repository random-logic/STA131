# Example: Poker
* $\Omega$ = {$w_1, ..., w_n$}
* Assume: $P(\{w_1\}) = ... = P(\{w_n\})$
* A hand is just a set of five cards drawn from deck
* A = { full house }
* 3 cards of one rank
* 2 cards of another rank
* $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$
* $|\Omega| = \binom{52}{5}$
* Choose one rank for the triple (13 ways)
* Choose one rank for the pair (12 ways)
* Choose three of four suits for triple ($\binom{4}{3}$)
* Choose two of four suits for the pair ($\binom{4}{3}$)
* $P(A) = \frac{13 * 12 * \binom{4}{3} * \binom{4}{3}}{\binom{52}{5}}$
* 2 of one rank and 3 other cards all of different ranks
* Choose one rank for pair 13 (13)
* Choose 3 of 12 remaining ranks for single cards ($\binom{12}{3}$)
* Choose 2 suits for pair ($\binom{4}{2}$)
* Choose 1 suit for each single card ($4^3$)
* $P(B) = \frac{13 * \binom{12}{3} * \binom{4}{2} * 4^3}{\binom{52}{5}}$

# Example: Ecology "Capture Recapture"
* There is a large population of n animals
* You catch 10 animals as a sample without replacement
* You tag the animals and release them back
* You catch a new sample of size 20 without replacement
* Let $m \in \{0, ..., 10\}$
* Let $A_m$ = {there are m tagged animals in sample size of 20}
* $P(A_m) = ?$
* Assume all samples of size 20 without replacement are equally likely
* $|\Omega| = \binom{n}{20}$
* Imagine you are filling up a tray of 20 items, part of it contains the m tagged animals, and 20 - m untagged
* There are $\binom{10}{m}$ ways of choosing tagged animals
* There are $\binom{n - 10}{20 - m}$ ways of choosing untagged animals
* If you plug the observed m into this formula, it becomes only a function of n, "likelihood function"
* $\hat n$ maximizes estimate of population size

# Conditional Probability
* We roll a 6 sided die twice
* | | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | | | | | | |
  | 2 | | | | | |*|
  | 3 | | | | |*| |
  | 4 | | | |*| | |
  | 5 | | |*| | | |
  | 6 | |*| | | | |
* A = {sum of two rolls is 8}
* $P(A) = \frac{5}{36}$
* B = {we roll a 3 on the first die}
* $P(A|B)=\frac{1}{6}$

# Def
* Let A and B be events in some general sample space $\Omega$. Assume $P(B)>0$
* Probability of A given B is $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
* If $B = \Omega$, then $P(A|\Omega) = \frac{P(A \cap \Omega)}{P(\Omega)} = P(A)$
* Consider the previous example, $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$

# Comment: Conditional probability is a new probability measure that satisfies all the axioms
* Let's fix an event B and define a new probability measure $\tilde P(A) = P(A | B)$
* $\tilde P(\Omega) = 1$
  * i.e. $\frac{P(\Omega \cap B)}{P(B)} = 1$
* $\tilde P(A) >= 0$
* $\tilde P(\cup A_i) = \sum \tilde P(A_i)$
  * $A_i$ are disjoint

# Multiplication laws for conditional probability
1. $P(A \cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$
2. Let $A_1 ... A_n$ be events (possibly not disjoint)
   * $P(\cap A_i) = P(A_1)P(A_2|A_1)...P(A_n|A_1\cap A_2\cap ...\cap A_{n - 1})$

# Example
* Jar with 4 marbles, 3 red, 1 blue
* You draw 2 marbles without replacement
* $R_1$ = {first draw is red}
* $R_2$ = {second draw is red}
* $P(R_1\cap R_2) = P(R_1)P(R_2|R_1)$

# Law of Total Probability
* Let $B_1$ through $B_n$ be a partition of $\Omega$
* i.e, all $B_i$ are disjoint and $\cup B_i = \Omega$
* Let $A \subset \Omega$ be any event
  * Then $P(A) = \sum P(A|B_i)P(B_i)$
* $B_i$ = {randomly drawn customer comes from zipcode i}
* A = {randomly drawn customer purchases the product}
* Divide and conquer strategy

# Why is Law of Total Probability True?
* $\sum P(A|B_i)P(B_i)$
* $\to \sum P(A \cap B_i)$
* $\to \sum P(C_i)$
* Note that $C_i$ are disjoint
* $\to P(\cup C_i)$ third axiom
* $\to P(\cup (A \cap B_i))$
* $\to P(A \cap (\cup B_i))$ distribution law
