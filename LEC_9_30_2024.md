# Equiprobable Outcomes
* Let $\Omega = \{w_1, ..., w_N\}$ where $P\{w_1\} = ... = P\{w_N\}$. Let $A \subset \Omega$.
* Then $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$

# Extended Multiple Principle
* Suppose there is a sequence of k experiments to be performed
* Suppose there are $n_1$ potential outcomes in the first experiment
* And for every outcome in the first experiment, there are $n_2$ outcomes in the second experiment
* ...
* And for every outcome in the first k-1 experiments, there are $n_k$ outcomes in the kth experiment
* then, there are $n_1 * n_2 * ... * n_k$ total outcomes.

# Permutations
* How many permutations of n items are there? n!

# Sampling when order matters
* How many samples of size r can be formed without replacement from n items? $\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$
* How many samples of size r can be formed with replacement from n items?
  * $n_1 = n$
  * $n_2 = n$
  * ...
  * $n_r = n$
  * Answer: $n^r$

# Definition: A combination is an unordered arrangement of things, ie {1, 2, 3} = {3, 2, 1}
* How many combinations of size r can be formed from n items?
* Ex: n = 4, r = 3
  * n items -> {a, b, c, d}
    | Combinations | Permutations |
    | --- | --- |
    | {a, b, c} | (a, b, c), (a, c, b), (b, a, c), (b, c, a), (c, a, b), (c, b, a) |
    | {a, b, d} | ... |
    | {b, c, d} | ... |
    | {a, c, d} | ... |
    | all combinations of size 3 | all samples of size 3 taken without replacement |
    | Let x = number of things on left | y = number of things on the right |
  * Note: $y = r! * x$
  * Answer: $x = \frac{y}{r!} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
  * This is the number of combinations of size r that can be formed n times
* Binomial coefficient: $\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$; "n-choose-r"

# Another perspective of binomials
* Think of partitioning n items into 2 buckets such that the first bucket has r items and the second bucket has n - r
* How many such partitions are there? $\binom{n}{r}$

# Example
* You run a business with 9 employees, and you want to partition them into three shifts (morning, afternoon, night).
* How many ways can this be done? We must allocate 3 to morning, 4 to afternoon, 2 to night
* $n_1 = \binom{9}{3}$
* $n_2 = \binom{6}{4}$
* $n_3 = \binom{2}{2}$
* The number of such partitions is $\binom{9}{3}\binom{6}{4}\binom{2}{2} = \frac{9!}{3!4!2!}$

# Multinomial Coefficient
* In general, suppose there are n items to partition into m buckets, with sizes $n_1, n_2, ..., n_m$ where $\sum n_i = n$
* The number of ways to do this is the following: $\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_m!} = \binom{n}{n_1, ..., n_m}$

# Example
* How many passwords can be formed from the letters S, T, A, T, I, S, T, I, C, S?
* Think of filling in 10 spaces with the different letters
* How many ways can we arrange the 2 S's in different buckets?
* For each arrangement, how can we arrange the rest of the letters?
* the multinomial coefficient says the number of passwords is $\binom{10}{3,3,1,2,1} = \frac{10!}{3!3!2!}$

# Example: Birthday Paradox
* There are n people in a room
* Assume all lists of n birthdays are equally likely
* $\Omega$ = {all lists of n birthdays}
* A = {at least two people have the same birthday}
* P(A) = ?
* The question is only interesting when n <= 365
* $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$
* It's actually easier to use
* $P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) = 1 - \frac{|A^c|}{|\Omega|}$
* $|\Omega| = 365^n$
* $|A^c| = 365 * 365 * 363 * ... * (365 - (n - 1))$
* $P(A) = 1 - \frac{365}{365} * \frac{364}{365} * \frac{363}{365} * ... * \frac{365 - (n - 1)}{365}$
* Note: n = 23, then P(A) is roughly 0.5

# Conditional Probability
* How to account for side information?
* Example: you roll a 6-sided die twice
* A = {sum of the 2 rolls is equal to 8}; |A| = 5
* If all outcomes are equally likely, $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{5}{36}$
* B = {first roll is a 3}
  * Lets calculate P(A) given B
  * Heuristic answer: $\frac{1}{6} = \frac{6}{36}$
